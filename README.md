## Course Introduction

Smart medicine, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) as its core technology, is a significant direction for future medical development. Medical imaging represents one of the most important applications of AI in the medical field today. Students in medical imaging need to learn basic AI knowledge and develop the fundamental skills for AI algorithm development. Meanwhile, students with backgrounds in information science and technology need to understand the specific requirements of imaging and medical imaging for AI.

This cross-disciplinary course aims to address the knowledge gaps for students from both backgrounds, enabling them to excel in intelligent medical imaging, conduct innovative research, and contribute to the healthcare industry.
